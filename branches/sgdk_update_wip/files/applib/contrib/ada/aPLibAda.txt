Usage
-----

The APLib package contains two generic procedures, Pack and Depack,
that you can use for compressing and decompressing any sort of data
into any other sort. For parametres, see specification: aplib.ads .

For the packed data type, it's simpler
to use an array of bytes, so you can easily calibrate
the safe size of packed data by calling the
function Evaluate_max_packed_space - see again aplib.ads.


Read apacdemo.adb to see an example how to implement it.


Binding the aPLib library
-------------------------

* For GNAT compiler make your program (here the demo) with the command

  [DOS:    ] gnatmake apacdemo -largs aplib.a   [lib from DJGPP]
  [Windows:] gnatmake apacdemo -largs aplib.lib [lib from VC]
  [Any:]     gnatmake apacdemo -largs aplib.xxx [lib from ???]

  Add usual options if needed.
  
  If you are using the AdaGIDE interface, just load apacdemo.adb and
  build (F3).

* For ObjectAda compiler it should work... but I didn't find
  how (it crashes for now).

Portability: full, provided the aPLib exists on your platform,
of course !

How to run the demo
-------------------

The command

  apacdemo a.x b.y c.z

will pack the contents of files a.x b.y c.z into
packed.000, packed.001, packed.002 and unpack into
pack_unp.000, pack_unp.001, pack_unp.002 .

Typical output:

________________________________________________________________
APack_Demo

Command: apacdemo file1 file2 file3 ...

When no file specified, 'apacdemo.exe' is used
The data are packed, unpacked and compared with originals.

File name: C:\Temp\Test

     [====/..............................................]  8%

Unpacked size    :     7885938
Packed size      :      706040
Work memory size :      655360
Compression ratio: 8%
Packed file name           : packed.001
Re-depacked file name      : pack_unp.001

Real time for compression  :  118.453919016
Real time for decompression:  0.172979478 - ratio  1.46031E-03
Unpacked and original being same: TRUE

How to get an Ada95 compiler
----------------------------

* Search the Net for the GNU compiler, named GNAT.
  Full Ada95 implementation with libraries & sources.
  
Free download: ftp://cs.nyu.edu/pub/gnat/
or search there:
  http://ftpsearch.lycos.com/cgi-bin/search?form=normal&query=gnat

Support: http://www.gnat.com/

There is a nice IDE for Windows, AdaGIDE @
  http://www.usafa.af.mil/dfcs/bios/mcc_html/adagide.html

* The DOS version of GNAT is in a distribution named EZ2LOAD.
It is unofficial and unsupported! Technically, there is "DJGPP inside".

Main:
  ftp://ftp.gwu.edu/pub/ada/ez2load/
Search:
  http://ftpsearch.lycos.com/cgi-bin/search?form=normal&query=ez2load

Current DOS version is GNAT 3.10p, using DJGPP 2.01 as back-end.
A GNAT 3.13p, using DJGPP 2.02, is currently being tested.

* There is also a commercial compiler for Windows, ObjectAda

    http://www.aonix.com/content/products/objectada/objectada.html

  with a _free_ version (number of lines/modules limited) that contains
all tools, however: the Microsoft tools, an IDE in Visual *** style,
command line tools also.

* If you really need to buy one, there is a cool one (not too
expensive), see http://www.rrsoftware.com/ .
