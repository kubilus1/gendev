GENDEV - Genesis development environment for Linux.

This is not meant to replace the SGDK (code.google.com/p/sgdk) but to
assist setting up a working Genesis development environment on *Nix.


Some descriptions ->


 * gendev/Makefile 


Makefile for setting up the required build tools.  Running this is enough for
a basic development environment.


 * gendev/sgdk/Makefile

Makefile for setting up SGDK for use on Linux


 * gendev/sgdk/skeleton

Some basic files to assist in building SGDK project under Linux.
